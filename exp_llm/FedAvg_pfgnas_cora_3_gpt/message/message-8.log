And the objective is to maximize the accuracy and ROC-AUC value of model.\n           A GNN architecture is defined as follows: \n           {\n               The first operation is input, the last operation is output, and the intermediate operations are candidate GNN operations and the activation function operations.\n          }\n           In search space, there are 9 most widely adopted GNN operations: gcn, sage, gpr, gat, gin, fc, sgc, arma and appnp. \n           For convenience, we use alphabetical codes to represent these GNN operations: {'a':'gcn', 'b':'sage', 'c':'gpr', 'd':'gat','e': 'gin', 'f':'fc', 'g':'sgc', 'h':'arma', 'i':'appnp'}\n           Besides, the activation function introduces non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn from complex patterns and relationships in the data. It takes the weighted sum of inputs and bias from the last layer of the model, applies a transformation, and produces the final output of the model. \n           There are 5 most widely adopted activation function operations: sigmoid, tanh, relu, linear and elu.\n           For convenience, we use number to represent these activation function operations: {'1':'sigmoid','2':'tanh', '3':'relu', '4':'linear','5': 'elu'}\n           Once again, your task is to help each client find the optimal combination of model operations on a given experimental dataset. \n        The main challenge lies in devising a rational search strategy for arranging the list of operations, where each chosen list corresponds to the highest achievable accuracy for those operations. \n        We can iteratively refine the search for the best operation lists by querying new lists based on existing ones and their corresponding performance. \n        The search strategy we set encompasses two stages: \n        1. Exploration Stage \u2013 in the initial phase of the search, you can randomly select a set of promising operation lists, considering some well-performing lists as candidates for the exploitation stage. \n        2. Exploitation Stage \u2013 with a certain amount of experimental results, in the exploitation stage, you should employ optimization algorithms such as Bayesian optimization or evolutionary algorithms to more effectively explore the optimal combinations of operations instead of random selection.#You can refer to the all historical experiment results.

poor models to avoid achieving such poor results again.#\nIn the above experimental results, there are some repetitive combinations of operations, as follows:ffh2-ghi2-heh5,ehe3-iii5-ged4,abb3-cee5-dac4,ifb3-adb1-aed1,cii3-iic4-gif5,ice2-dag1-aff2,dab1-baa1-fec2,gif5-hie1-afh3,ifh4-fih4-dfc5,ggi2-icd2-acf2,.\nThe combinations you propose should be strictly #different# from the structure of the existing experimental results.#You should not raise the combinations that are already present in the above experimental results again.#\n\nPlease propose 10 better and #different# combinations of operations with accuracy strictly greater than 0.73628,  while also having an ROC_AUC value strictly greater than 0.66925 on cora dataset.\n\n#Due to the availability of a certain number of experimental results, I believe it is currently in the Exploitation stage. You should choose nearby samples that temporarily display the best results for searching, especially those that rank in the top 10% or 20% of existing experimental results. At the same time, you should try to avoid exploring sample structures with poor results, which can cause waste.#\n\n Please do not include anything other than the operation list in your response.\n        You should provide 10 federated models at once, where each federated model consists of a combination of sub-models from 3 clients, connected with '-'.    \n        The sub-model for each client should consist of 4 operations. The first three are GNN operations (i.e., 'a':'gcn', 'b':'sage', 'c':'gpr', 'd':'gat','e': 'gin', 'f':'fc', 'g':'sgc', 'h':'arma', 'i':'appnp'), and the last one is an activation function operation('1':'sigmoid','2':'tanh', '3':'relu', '4':'linear','5': 'elu'), chosen from the search space described above.\n   For a model with 3 clients, your response only need include the federated models list,  the formatted as follows::\n1. client1-client2-client3: cia4-adc1-afb3\n2. client1-client2-client3: fha3-hia3-gch2\n3. client1-client2-client3: bfb1-hci5-ghi3\n4. client1-client2-client3: cfe3-gai2-aea2\n5. client1-client2-client3: ccb4-dia2-dhb3\n6. client1-client2-client3: bdf3-gei1-cag4\n7. client1-client2-client3: cbi1-dbb1-cdb2\n8. client1-client2-client3: aih4-eig2-dgg5\n9. client1-client2-client3: aag5-cbh3-aib5\n10. client1-client2-client3: fef3-agb1-eda4\n"}]
