"A federated scenario refers to a situation where there are multiple clients (for example, multiple organizations, devices, or users) working together to achieve a goal, but there may be a need for data isolation and privacy protection between them. In a federated graph scenario, with 3 clients, each holding a segment of the cora graph dataset, the task is to customize the choice of the best sub-model for each client within the search space. This is done with the goal of maximizing accuracy and ROC-AUC values across all clients. This can be achieved through a personalized federated learning framework, which is defined as follows: \n           {It consists of sub-architectures from n clients. For each sub-architecture, the initial operation is the input, the final operation is the output, and the intermediate 4 operators consisit of candidate GNN operations and activation function operators of search sapce. }\n           In search space, there are 9 most widely adopted GNN operators: 'gcn', 'sage', 'gpr', 'gat', 'gin', 'fc', 'sgc', 'arma', 'appnp', 'identity' and 'zero', you should consider the advantages and disadvantages of these GNN operators.\n           Besides, the activation function introduces non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn from complex patterns and relationships in the data. It takes the weighted sum of inputs and bias from the last layer of the model, applies a transformation, and produces the final output of the model. \n           There are 5 most widely adopted activation function operators: sigmoid, tanh, relu, linear and elu.\n           Once again, your task is to search the optimal personalized federated models, this is, help all client search the optimal intermediate operations of sub-models on a given experimental dataset. \n        The search strategy we set encompasses two stages: \n        1. Exploration Stage: in the initial stage of the search, you should focus more on exploring the entire search space randomly, rather than just focusing on the current local optimal results. \n        2. Exploitation Stage: with a certain amount of experimental results, in the exploitation stage, you can iteratively refine the search for the best operation lists by querying new lists based on existing ones and their corresponding performance. You should employ optimization algorithms such as Bayesian optimization or evolutionary algorithms to more effectively explore the optimal combinations of operations instead of random selection.#For simplicity, we use keys represent GNN operators and activation function operators: 'a':'gcn', 'b':'sage', 'c':'gpr', 'd':'gat', 'e': 'gin', 'f':'fc', 'g':'sgc', 'h':'arma', 'i':'appnp','j':'identity', 'k':'zero','1':'sigmoid','2':'tanh', '3':'relu', '4':'linear','5': 'elu'. You can refer to the historical experiment results, and \n            The currently tested frameworks include:\n['gga3-ihg3-hfj2', 'ice2-bje5-jce1', 'jhf2-fbd5-ddc5', 'jga3-ihg3-hfj2', 'jce2-bje5-jce1', 'abb3-cke3-jdj1', 'jkc4-kgi3-ihi3', 'chg5-fjf3-hcg4', 'abb1-cke1-jdj3', 'jkc4-kgi1-ihi3', 'chg5-fjf1-hcg4', 'abb2-cke2-jdj3', 'jkc4-kgi2-ihi3', 'chg5-fjf2-hcg4', 'abd3-cke3-jij1', 'abd3-cke3-jdj1']\n The current top five models with the best performance are: \nFramework jhf2-fbd5-ddc5 achieves a test accuracy of 0.8227\u00b10.0377 and a test ROC-AUC of 0.6865\u00b10.0094 on server.\nFramework gga3-ihg3-hfj2 achieves a test accuracy of 0.7925\u00b10.0148 and a test ROC-AUC of 0.6756\u00b10.0044 on server.\nFramework jga3-ihg3-hfj2 achieves a test accuracy of 0.7731\u00b10.0141 and a test ROC-AUC of 0.6750\u00b10.0034 on server.\nFramework abb3-cke3-jdj1 achieves a test accuracy of 0.7698\u00b10.0412 and a test ROC-AUC of 0.6768\u00b10.0174 on server.\nFramework jkc4-kgi3-ihi3 achieves a test accuracy of 0.7697\u00b10.0142 and a test ROC-AUC of 0.6777\u00b10.0064 on server.\n I hope you can learn the commonalities between the well performing models to achieve better results #and avoid the mistakes of poor models to avoid achieving such poor results again.#\n\nThe frameworks you propose should be strictly #different# from the structure of the existing experimental results. #You should not raise the combinations that are already present in the above experimental results again.#\n\nPlease provide 10 better and #different# frameworks with accuracy strictly greater than 0.7266,  while also having an ROC_AUC value strictly greater than 0.6691 on cora dataset.\n\n#Due to the availability of a certain number of experimental results, it is currently in the Exploitation stage. You should choose nearby samples that temporarily display the best results for searching, especially those that rank in the top 10% or 20% of existing experimental results. At the same time, you should try to avoid exploring sample structures with poor results, which can cause waste.#\n\n there are 11 GNN operators: ['gcn', 'sage', 'gpr', 'gat',  'gin', 'fc', 'sgc', 'arma', 'appnp', 'identity', 'zero'], and there are 5 activation function operators: ['sigmoid', 'tanh', 'relu', 'linear', 'elu' ]. \n               Each sub-architecture for each client should include #4 operators# : the first three operators are GNN operations, and the fourth is an activation function operator, such as ['fc', 'fc', 'gpr', 'sigmoid']. \n               And each federated framework is composed of #3 sub-architectures#, for example, a federated framework can be represented as a list:  [['gcn', 'sage', 'sage', 'relu'], ['gpr', 'zero', 'gin', 'relu'], ['identity', 'gat', 'identity', 'sigmoid']]. In your response, adhere strictly to the format exemplified below, for example: Assuming there are 3 clients in each federated scenario, please provide #5# different personalized federated framework. For example:\n1: [['gcn', 'sage', 'sage', 'relu'], ['gpr', 'zero', 'gin', 'relu'], ['identity', 'gat', 'identity', 'sigmoid']]\n2: [['identity', 'zero', 'gpr', 'linear'], ['zero', 'sgc', 'appnp', 'relu'], ['appnp', 'arma', 'appnp', 'relu']]\n...\n5: [['gpr', 'arma', 'sgc', 'elu'], ['fc', 'identity', 'fc', 'relu'], ['arma', 'gpr', 'sgc', 'linear']]\n\n Please do not include anything other than the framework list in your response and follow the rules below:\n                        1. Do not use capital letters.\n                        2. Do not privode operators other than the specified GNN operators and the activation function operators.\n                        3. Strictly adhere to the format shown in the example above.\n                        4. Do not provide duplicate frameworks"
