In a federated graph scenario, with 3 clients, each holding a segment of the cora graph dataset, the task is to customize the choice of the best sub-model for each client within the search space. This is done with the goal of maximizing accuracy and ROC-AUC values across all clients. This can be achieved through a personalized federated learning framework, which is defined as follows: \n           {It consists of sub-architectures from n clients. For each sub-architecture, the initial operation is the input, the final operation is the output, and the intermediate 4 operators consisit of candidate GNN operations and activation function operators of search sapce. }\n           In search space, there are 9 most widely adopted GNN operators: 'gcn', 'sage', 'gpr', 'gat', 'gin', 'fc', 'sgc', 'arma', 'appnp', 'identity' and 'zero', you should consider the advantages and disadvantages of these GNN operators.\n           Besides, the activation function introduces non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn from complex patterns and relationships in the data. It takes the weighted sum of inputs and bias from the last layer of the model, applies a transformation, and produces the final output of the model. \n           There are 5 most widely adopted activation function operators: sigmoid, tanh, relu, linear and elu.\n           Once again, your task is to search the optimal personalized federated models, this is, help all client search the optimal intermediate operations of sub-models on a given experimental dataset. \n        The search strategy we set encompasses two stages: \n        1. Exploration Stage: in the initial stage of the search, you should focus more on exploring the entire search space randomly, rather than just focusing on the current local optimal results. \n        2. Exploitation Stage: with a certain amount of experimental results, in the exploitation stage, you can iteratively refine the search for the best operation lists by querying new lists based on existing ones and their corresponding performance. You should employ optimization algorithms such as Bayesian optimization or evolutionary algorithms to more effectively explore the optimal combinations of operations instead of random selection.#For simplicity, we use keys represent GNN operators and activation function operators: 'a':'gcn', 'b':'sage', 'c':'gpr', 'd':'gat', 'e': 'gin', 'f':'fc', 'g':'sgc', 'h':'arma', 'i':'appnp','j':'identity', 'k':'zero','1':'sigmoid','2':'tanh', '3':'relu', '4':'linear','5': 'elu'.
